Credits for the base project to [NeuralLine](https://www.youtube.com/@NeuralNine).

To get the base project running check his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mEmE7pBI1A&t=7s).

I have extended the project introducing translation capabilities to learn new words.

I have included the possibility to recieve emails with the top news and their translation.
